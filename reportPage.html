      <p class="perfume_market">The market share growth by the offline segment will be significant during the forecast
        period. Stores like department stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets<br>and specialty shops are among the offline
        distribution channels. Players broaden their product portfolios in the global, regional, and local markets to
        boost sales through offline channels.The offline segment was valued at USD 551.10 million in 2017 and
        continued to grow until 2021. Small stores that serve a single retail market are known as specialty stores or
        flagship stores. These retail establishments offer a specific selection of goods and accessories<br> related to a
        certain genre or category. Specialty stores keep a sizable supply of the product they are selling on hand. </p>
